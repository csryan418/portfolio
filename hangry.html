              There are a number of restaurant and map apps on the market, however, 
              there is very little truly live information that can help users decide which 
              restaurant to go to where they will not have to wait and will have an 
              overall pleasant experience.

            <h3><strong>The Problem</strong></h3>
            <p>
              Yelp, Google Maps, Open Table, etc all provide users information about 
              reviews, location, hours, menus, and general restaurant details, however, 
              there is no current app on the market that provides real-time, live 
              information about a restaurants wait time, line length, or noise levels. 
              Restaurant goers are left in the dark about this type of information until 
              they arrive at the restaurant. Arriving at a restaurant that is too crowded 
              or busy can mean restaurant goers turn away and go somewhere else.

          <div class="col-md-6 bg-light">
            <h3><strong>The Solution</strong></h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Hangry</strong> is the only user-submitted, and community-based app (similar to Waze) 
              that provides real-time details about a restaurants wait time, line length, 
              and noise levels so that users can know ahead of time if it is worth going to 
              that restaurant or if they should go somewhere else. This information is reported 
              by actual users, rather than in partnership with the restaurant, so others can 
              trust the information to be accurate.

              To begin, I surveyed a wide range of users across multiple

              understanding of their current use of restaurant, search, and map apps, to
              get an understanding of their likes, dislikes, frustrations, and to get an
              understanding of the limitations that each felt regarding their
              app(s) of choice.

            <ul>
              <li><strong>100</strong>% of surveyors reported that they have gotten to a 
                restaurant or bar only to find that it is too crowded and they aren’t willing 
                to wait</li>
              <li><strong>91</strong>% of surveyors find that scenario to be very frustrating, 
                frustrating, or somewhat frustrating </li>
              <li>
                <strong>62</strong>% of surveyors use an app to look up restaurants in their area, 
                with Google Maps, Yelp, and Open Table being the most popular
              </li>
              <li>

              <li><strong>Key user suggestions:</strong> 1. Provide an incentive for people to
              submit information (similar to Open Table's rewards program.<br>2. Make it as easy as possible

                  ahead of time would definitely help his decision.

                  Miguel gets hangry and is very impatient when it comes to waiting. He hates waiting
                  especially when it comes to food. His friends can attest to how grumpy he can get.

                  Would really like to have the ability to check out if a restaurant is crowded or

                  Gets frustrated when she shows up to a restaurant only to find that it is too
                  crowded to get a table and the wait is 30+ minutes. She's usually only willing to wait
                  a minimum of 20 minutes otherwise she is going somewhere else.

              until all user flows had been successfully wireframed.

                  At this point, I decided to do an initial round of usability testing with the app’s wireframes to ensure that I was going in the correct direction and to ensure a good user experience. Firstly, I used “Marvel” to test 5 different scenarios for the user to go through: 1. Learn about the app, go through onboarding, and sign up or log in; 2. Search for a restaurant called “Don’t Look Back” and go to the restaurant page; 3. Submit restaurant details; 4. Go to the rewards points page; 5. Review notification and submit details.

              After wireframes had been created digitally, I began the process of creating 
              a brand concept for this app. I first started with mind-mapping & word 
              association to begin the branding process which ultimately led to the name 
              as well as some logo concepts. I then developed a moodboard to further the 
              branding process and to help with the look and feel of the app.

        <div class="col-md-8 py-5">
          <p>
              Based off of the moodboard, I developed some logo ideas and went through 
              some iterations. Initially, I had 2 logo ideas, the wolf and a crab. I 
              ultimately decided to A/B test these concepts to see what other potential users preferred 
              based on the concept and brand idea. The wolf had a slight preference 
              overall at 58% so from there I continued iterating on the wolf logo concept.

                Once that process had been completed, I developed an overall app 
                color scheme. The last step in the branding process was the creation 
                of a style guide that included detailed information about the logo, 
                color scheme, typography, UI elements, and overall brand look and feel.

              Once the high fidelity mockups were complete, the testing commenced so 
              that design iterations and changes could be implemented based off of 
              those results.. Tools such as InVision, Maze, and Usability Hub were 
              utilized for usability testing as well as A/B testing in order to ensure 
              an ideal user experience was achieved.

              <strong>User testing results:</strong><br>
              <br>To begin testing, I conducted a number of remote and in-person usability 
              tests and as well as deployed Maze tests. Overall, users thought that the app was easy and straightforward with only a few 
              recommendations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It seems that the “filter” process is something that needs to be slightly 
                adjusted - possibly bringing more attention to that CTA by increasing 
                the size or weight of the icon 
              </li>
              <li>
                Adjust bottom toolbar to bring more attention to search icon so that users 
                can easily access and it is clear
              </li>
              <li>
                Bring more attention to "more details" area of restaurant pop up information
              </li>

            The biggest takeaway from testing was the ease at which users were having, which
            was very encouraging! The app itself seems very user-friendly and familiar to users.
            The biggest challenge is to ensure users are motivated to utilize the full functionality
            of the app as its success relies on user input. It is crucial to ensure that users
            are aware of the benefits and rewards of submitting information into the app.

                <strong>What worked?</strong>  Iterating and in-person/remote usability testing. Based on feedback and usability test results, further changes became clear and improvements were made to further enhance the overall user experience of the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What didn't work?</strong> Maze testing. Given that there are multiple ways to use this sort of an app, it was difficult to create a “mission” and have there be a successful ending point when in reality this is not necessary for this app. I was able to still use the results as I analyzed users click patterns and heat maps, which showed that users were actually completing the mission successfully.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Doubts going into the project:</strong> That I would be the only one that would find an app like this helpful.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Most surprise by:</strong> Based on survey results, an overwhelming majority of those surveyed listed live wait time as a feature that they wished their current restaurant app had.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What would I have done differently if given more time?</strong> I would redo the Maze test and try to find more participants to do in-person/remote usability testing. Maze allowed for saving time, however, the results were a bit skewed and with doing in-person or remote usability testing, I am better able to get direct user feedback rather than asking users at the end of a Maze test to voluntarily provide feedback.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What I learned:</strong> That not only myself, but others think that this app would be useful. The feedback was very positive and now find myself wishing that this were a real app.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Future use:</strong> Producing projects based on real-life frustrations or coming up with something that is lacking in your own life can make for a successful project, as it becomes clear that you are not the only one wishing this were an actual app. This is also backed up by the fact that Yelp just purchased the NoWait at for $40 million!!

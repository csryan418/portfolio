          <p>
            Even given the seemingly saturated market of cloud-based storage and
            organization products, we were tasked with developing a product that
            could fill an underutilized need in that space. To accomplish this,
            we will need to have the right combination of features to meet the
            needs of a particular audience.

            <h3><strong>The Problem</strong></h3>
            <p>
              The cloud storage and file management space is full of products,
              but there a few that truly fulfill the needs of all users
              especially from a collaboration standpoint. Additionally, there
              are few that cross over between both personal and professional
              use.

              Inspired by the Git and Github workflow, <strong>Fuse</strong> is
              a cloud-based version control and file management hub for
              everything from your school projects to your client presentations
              that allows for collaboration across all files.

              To begin, I surveyed a wide range of users across multiple
              demographics, age groups, and professions, in order to get an
              understanding of their current use of cloud storage products, to
              get an understanding of their frustrations, and to get an
              understanding of the limitations that each felt regarding their
              product of choice.<br />

              If a product had a feature that allowed collaborators to "fork"
              (or make their own copy or branch of) the file, which you could
              then ultimately approve as the "file owner" do you think you would

              <strong>Dropbox</strong> seems to answer a lot of those questions

              <strong>Box</strong> seems to really market itself solely to

            Based on research, competitive analysis, and user stories, user
            flows were then developed in order to map out the ideal user
            experience. These were first sketched out by hand and then
            digitally. User flows included: onboarding, uploading and
            organizing, sharing a file/folder, creating a folder, creating a
            copy, and approving/disapproving/merging.

            Referring back to the user flows, wireframes were created for each
            task. Firstly, sketches were drawn of the initial design ideas and
            then they were produced digitally. This was a continuous process
            until all user flows had been successfully wireframed.

            research, sketching, refinement, moodboards, deciding on a color
            palette, and developing a style guide. Given that this product was
            inspired by Git/Github, I wanted to convey a sense of having
            different parts, but that all come together in the end to complete
            the overall picture. So users are able to create copies of the same
            file, make changes, and then merge it together to make one single,
            finished product.

          <p>
            The name “Fuse” was chosen based on the product’s concept. Once that
            was chosen, I began the process of developing a logo. Starting with
            sketching, I progressed to digital ideas and worked through various
            iterations of the idea based on feedback. In the process, I
            developed a color palette and a moodboard which allowed me to
            ultimately decide on the colors of the logo. After receiving
            feedback on my initial logo idea, I decided to change the idea
            slightly after realizing that when the logo was made smaller, it
            would not be as clear. I decided to go with the idea of different
            colors overlaying each other to form different colors. The idea
            behind this tries to show the idea behind Fuse itself. Lastly, I
            developed a style guide to show the overall branding, typeface,
            logo, and theme of Fuse.

                    After completely usability testing with Maze, it showed that all users were ultimately able to complete the tasks successfully, however, most took an indirect path to success. The placement of the “merge with master” button was causing some confusion so I decided to preference test the button placement in 4 different locations. <strong>69%</strong> of testers preferred the button to be placed in the top left hand area of the page. The results were non-conclusive as to if the testers preferred the button to be over the text or to have the text in the center area of the page.

                    The biggest takeaway from the usability testing is that the overall “workflow” of the product tended to cause some users confusion. Even with that, all users completed the tasks successfully, but took an indirect path to success. This tended to not be the case if users took the time to learn about the product from the welcome/marketing pages tended to perform better.

                <p>Because users who took the time to learn about the product from the welcome/ marketing pages tended to perform better, if more time permits, it would be helpful to build out “walk through” directions for new users so that the workflow is clearer. From the test results, it became clear that this may be necessary and could help with taking my conception and making it clearer to the end user from the “get-go.”
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, from the entire project, I learned that I need to test early and test often. This is crucial to ensuring that I didn’t go down a road that may not be the best choice. Additionally, if I ever felt stuck, it was best to turn that into a preference test and let the users ultimately decided for me. Also, I realized that I needed to develop a strong design system so that my work could be more efficient.
                </p><br>
                
                <p>Overall, I believe that the user research that was completed shows that there is a need for additional features than the current selection of cloud storage products provides. The functionality that Fuse provides in being able to create versions of multiple different file types, collaborate on those files with other users, and then ultimately merge them into the best, final version, addresses some of these current shortcomings.
